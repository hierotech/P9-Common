The encoded method argument values are\nconcatenated (with some fun complications around \"packing\" consecutive\nbit values into bytes).\n\nAlong with the types given in frames, method arguments may be long\nbyte strings (`longstr`, not required to be UTF8) or 64 bit unsigned\nintegers to be interpreted as timestamps (yeah I don't know why\neither), or arbitrary sets of key-value pairs (called `field-table`).\n\nInside a field table the keys are `shortstr` and the values are\nprefixed with a byte tag giving the type. The types are any of the\nabove except for bits (which are replaced by byte-wide `bool`), along\nwith a NULL value `void`, a special fixed-precision number encoding\n(`decimal`), IEEE754 `float`s and `double`s, signed integers,\n`field-array` (a sequence of tagged values), and nested field-tables.\n\nRabbitMQ and QPid use a subset of the field-table types, and different\nvalue tags, established before the AMQP 0-9-1 specification was\npublished. So far as I know, no-one uses the types and tags as\npublished. http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-errata.html gives the\nlist of field-table types.\n\nLastly, there are (sets of) properties, only one of which is given in\nAMQP 0-9-1: `BasicProperties`. These are almost the same as methods,\nexcept that they appear in content header frames, which include a\ncontent size, and they carry a set of flags indicating which\nproperties are present.

If we're\n//    really too busy to even run the check for two whole heartbeat\n//    intervals, there must be a lot of I (but not O, at least not on\n//    the connection), or computation, in which case perhaps it's best\n//    the server cuts us off anyway.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

prepared from the same arguments\nand options. The arguments marshalling is done here. Each of the\nprocedures below takes arguments and options (the latter in an object)\nparticular to the operation it represents, and returns an object with\nfields for handing to the encoder.\n*/\n\n// A number of AMQP methods have a table-typed field called\n// `arguments`, that is intended to carry extension-specific\n// values. RabbitMQ uses this in a number of places; e.g., to specify\n// an 'alternate exchange'.\n//\n// Many of the methods in this API have an `options` argument, from\n// which I take both values that have a default in AMQP (e.g.,\n// autoDelete in QueueDeclare) *and* values that are specific to\n// RabbitMQ (e.g., 'alternate-exchange'), which would normally be\n// supplied in `arguments`. So that extensions I don't support yet can\n// be used, I include `arguments` itself among the options.\n//\n// The upshot of this is that I often need to prepare an `arguments`\n// value that has any values passed in `options.arguments` as well as\n// any I've promoted to being options themselves. Since I don't want\n// to mutate anything passed in, the general pattern is to create a\n// fresh object with the `arguments` value given as its prototype; all\n// fields in the supplied value will be serialised, as well as any I\n// set on the fresh object.
